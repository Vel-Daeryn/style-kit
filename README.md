# style-kit
A personal, learning-oriented style kit built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.

---

This repository is a personal style guide focused on front-end fundamentals.

It documents the visual foundations I reuse across projects:
design tokens, layout primitives, and small UI building blocks — built using HTML, CSS, and minimal Vanilla JavaScript.

This is not a framework and not a production-ready library, but a learning-oriented toolbox designed to reinforce best practices.

## Objectives

Build a solid understanding of design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)

Practice writing accessible, semantic HTML

Structure CSS for clarity, reuse, and maintainability

Document UI decisions and trade-offs clearly

Create a reusable reference for future projects

## Scope

Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)

Layout primitives

Basic UI components

Accessibility-first patterns

Minimal, intentional JavaScript when necessary

## Philosophy

Vanilla only (no CSS or JS frameworks)

Small, focused building blocks

Clarity over abstraction

Accessibility as a default

Documentation as part of the learning process

## Notes

This project evolves incrementally as my understanding grows.
Decisions may change, be refactored, or simplified over time.

### This project is intentionally limited in scope and evolves progressively.
